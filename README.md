# pic-coloring
Implemented parts of the program that can color the input pictureâ€™s borders, color the picture with solid color following the borders, or color the picture in fading color when given a center point.
Experimented two ways of coloring using depth-first search and breadth-first search.
Used stacks and queues for different coloring techniques.
